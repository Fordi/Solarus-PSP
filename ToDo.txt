What is needed for the PSP version to work at a descent speed :

- Rewrite the Audio & Video and apply PSP resolution (The worst part, Navi's Quest port will help)
- search for physfs lib for psp, it exists but need a lot of web search.

[DONE] Use the 64mb of the PSP slim, brite
[DONE] HQx shaders are gone.
[DONE] Rebind keyboard map to PSP map (Todo : Select is unused, it need to be binded to something)
[DONE] Delete HQx Shaders, useless, PSP wouldn't handle this anyway.
[DONE] Delete SPC support, it is stated to take some ressources and it is useless since IT replaced it
[DONE] Delete Mouse Input support, PSP don't have any, I don't know why it should still exist

Main project related : 
- Delete some other things, there will be another version of Solarus PSP for my project, performance wise
- Delete IT support, project work with OGG, supported by the PSP too
