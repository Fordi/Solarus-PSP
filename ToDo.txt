What is needed for the PSP version to work at a descent speed :

- Test the current build, all libraries has been ported to the PSP.
Everything has been redone for 1.4.5. 

[DONE] Rewrite the Audio & Video and apply PSP resolution (OpenAl & SDL_Mixer is already ported to the PSP)
[DONE] Port Physfs
[DONE] Use the 64mb of the PSP slim, brite
[DONE] HQx shaders are gone, useless, the PSP doesn't have that much power and battery life would be sucked away.
[DONE] Rebind keyboard map to PSP map (Todo : Select is unused, it need to be binded to something)
[DONE] Delete HQx Shaders, useless, PSP wouldn't handle this anyway.
[DONE] Delete SPC support, it is stated to take some ressources and it is useless since IT replaced it
[DONE] Delete Mouse Input support, PSP don't have any, I don't know why it should still exist
