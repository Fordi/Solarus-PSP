What is needed for the PSP version to work at a descent speed :
- Delete HQx Shaders, useless, PSP wouldn't handle this anyway.
- Delete SPC support, it is stated to take some ressources and it is useless since IT replaced it
- Rewrite the Audio & Video and apply PSP resolution (The worst part, Navi's Quest port will help)
- Rebind keyboard map to PSP map

Thing done :
- Use the 64mb on the PSP
- HQx shaders are gone.

Main project related : 
- Delete some other things, there will be another version of Solarus PSP for my project, performance wise
- Delete IT support, project work with OGG, supported by the PSP too
