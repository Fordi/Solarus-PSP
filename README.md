# Solarus-PSP

Work in Progress port of the Solarus Engine (Version 1.4.5) to the PlayStation Portable.

Current State : Testing
Build Passing : Not Tested Yet

I really don't know if the engine would run 100% fine, but a canceled Wii port (http://forum.solarus-games.org/index.php/topic,27.0.html) run at fullspeed, on 24mb of ram.

Using tools & Compiler : PSPSdk
